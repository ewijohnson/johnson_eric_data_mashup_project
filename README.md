IS 590 OMO video game music composer project

## About
This project finds and collects online data from a variety of
sources and combines it into a single, novel dataset. 

This project looks at data on video games and video game composers. 

## Research Questions
The final dataset aims to allow for analysis to answer these questions, and related
questions, that cannot be answered by any one dataset currently in existence.

Are there any correlations between:
    
* The age of a composer and the rating of a soundtrack?
* The average rating of a video game and how highly ranked its soundtrack is?
* The ranking of a video game soundtrack and the game genre?
* Which soundtracks are highly ranked and the game's ESRB rating?
    
Does a given composer tend to write music for a certain game genre, or is there
a tendency to not be limited by game genre?

## Background on the Project
This research idea came about from my love of video game music. While I enjoy playing video games, I often find 
myself listening to soundtracks from many games while I do other work. It is a unique genre of music, similar to 
contemporary classical, yet less cinematic than movie soundtracks. It is almost atmospheric, but more melodic. While 
video game programmers and game designers are often talked about and discussed, video game music continues to be a 
more obscure topic, which can be seen in the lack of diverse data on video game music and its composers. 

Additionally, even though the soundtrack for a game is inherently vital—bad music can completely ruin a game, but 
good music can often go unnoticed—it is not discussed to the same degree as the game itself or included in reviews 
of the game. Despite all of this, the popularity of video game music is clear. Browse through YouTube or Spotify, 
and it’ll be obvious that many people listen to video game soundtracks, based off of the high play counts and positive 
comments.

My project therefore aims to take a closer look at this music and the composers who write it. Are certain composers 
more popular than others? Do some composers write music for games that are popular, but the music isn’t? Is there a 
correlation between the most popular games and the highest rated soundtracks? What about the lowest ranked games—is 
the music for these games ranked poorly as well? Does the age of a composer have any correlation with how well their 
music is received? What about game genre—do some genres seem to be associated with more music that people enjoy 
listening to? Do composers tend to work within certain genres, or do they often compose for diverse genres? 

An in-depth look of the music of video games has not been done before, and my project will create one dataset that 
can be used for analyzing these questions as well as others. Hopefully it will also inspire others to continue looking 
more deeply into video game music, and highlight music and composers as an integral part of video games.
